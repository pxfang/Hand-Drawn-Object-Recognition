# Hand-Drawn Object Recognition and Prediction
Implementing a Convolutional Neural Network model instead of Recurrent Neural Network model, to recognize and predict hand-drawn objects using TensorFlow.js. The ConvNet model has been trained on the QuickDraw dataset, which consists of ~400,000 images derived from hand-drawn samples, using 1 million parameters and an input size of [28 x 28 x 1]. It recognizes and predicts 100 classes of objects, currently up to 92.4% accuracy.
