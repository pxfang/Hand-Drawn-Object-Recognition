# Hand-Drawn Object Recognition and Prediction
Implementation of a ConvNet neural model using TensorFlow.js, to recognize and predict hand-drawn objects. The CNN model has been trained on the QuickDraw dataset, which consists of ~400,000 images derived from hand-drawn samples, using 1 million parameters and an input size of [28 x 28 x 1]. It recognizes and predicts 100 classes of objects, currently up to 92.4% accuracy.
